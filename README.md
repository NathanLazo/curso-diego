# next-base
Next.js base for developers who want to fast develop with Next or have problems creating next app.

## About 
I was struggling creating a next.js app on windows, so I created this boilerplate to fast develop with this framework.

## How to use
Create a folder
```bash
mkdir folder_name
```
CD into your folder
```bash
cd folder_name
```
In your console type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanLazo/next-base.git
```
CD into next-base
```bash
cd next-base
```
Then:
```bash
npm install
```
Last, test:
```bash
npm run dev
```
